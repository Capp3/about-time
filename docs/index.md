  4. Use UV for all Python package management

- **Weekly Schedule**:
  - Monday-Tuesday: Implementation
  - Wednesday: Testing and review
  - Thursday: Refinement and fixes
  - Friday: Demo and planning

## Getting Started

1. Review the PRD and project brief
2. Understand the implementation plan
3. Follow the development principles
4. Set up your environment using UV guidelines
