# About Time - System Patterns

## Frontend Patterns

### Component Structure
- React functional components with hooks
- TypeScript for type safety
- Separation of UI components from data fetching logic

### State Management
- React Context API for global state
- Local component state for UI-specific state
- Form handling with controlled components

### API Communication
- Axios for API requests
- CSRF token handling for authenticated requests
- Error handling and loading states

### Form Patterns
- Form validation on client and server
- Immediate feedback for invalid inputs
- Consistent error message display

## Backend Patterns

### Django Project Structure
- Modular Django apps (common, users, etc.)
- RESTful API design using Django REST Framework
- Use of Django's built-in authentication system

### Model Design
- Extended Django User model via OneToOne relationship
- Soft deletes for preserving audit trail
- Consistent use of created_at/updated_at timestamps
- Audit logging for important model changes

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (Employee/Manager)
- Permission checking in views and serializers
- Session-based authentication with CSRF protection

### Business Logic
- Service-layer pattern for complex business logic
- Calculated fields handled at model level when possible
- Transaction management for multi-step operations

## Database Patterns

### Table Design
- Appropriate field types and constraints
- Foreign keys with CASCADE or PROTECT deletion behavior
- Indexes on frequently queried fields

### Query Optimization
- Select_related and prefetch_related for reducing queries
- Database-level calculations when appropriate
- Efficient pagination for large datasets

## Testing Patterns

### Frontend Testing
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- End-to-end tests with Cypress
- Mock API responses for isolated component testing

### Backend Testing
- Unit tests for models and business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Test fixtures for common test data

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality
- ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Black and isort for Python
- Pre-commit hooks for enforcing code style

### Documentation
- Docstrings for Python functions and classes
- JSDoc comments for TypeScript functions and components
- README files for major components and features
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for REST API

### Deployment
- Docker containers for consistent environments
- Docker Compose for local development
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
