# Creative Decisions Index

This directory contains documentation of creative design work, architecture decisions, and implementation approaches for key components of the About Time application. Each document includes the design process, options considered, selected approach, and implementation guidelines.

## Components

### Business Logic Components

- [Overtime Calculation System](overtime_calculation_design.md) - Service-based approach for calculating overtime hours based on configurable settings

### UI Components

_No UI component designs yet_

### API Components

_No API component designs yet_

## Design Process

Our creative design process follows these steps:

1. **Problem Definition**

   - Clearly define the component's requirements and constraints
   - Identify any technical or business limitations

2. **Options Analysis**

   - Generate multiple design options
   - Analyze pros and cons of each approach
   - Consider maintainability, testability, and extensibility

3. **Selection**

   - Choose the best approach based on requirements
   - Justify the selection with clear reasoning

4. **Implementation Guidelines**

   - Provide code examples and patterns
   - Address edge cases and considerations
   - Include testing strategies

5. **Verification**
   - Ensure the selected approach meets all requirements
   - Validate against future extensibility needs

## Adding New Design Documents

When documenting a new design decision:

1. Create a markdown file named `component_name_design.md`
2. Add an entry to this index file
3. Use the standard template (see template below)
4. Include code samples for implementation

## Standard Template

```markdown
# Component Name - Design Document

## Overview

Brief description of the component and its purpose.

## Design Process

### Problem Definition

List of requirements and constraints.

### Explored Options

#### Option 1: [Name]

**Approach:** Brief description.

**Pros:**

- Pro 1
- Pro 2

**Cons:**

- Con 1
- Con 2

#### Option 2: [Name]

...

## Selected Approach

The selected approach and reasoning.

## Implementation Design

Code samples and guidelines.

## Implementation Considerations

Edge cases and special considerations.

## Future Extensibility
