# About Time - Progress Tracking

## Project Timeline

- **Week 1**: Project initialization and setup (Current)
- **Week 2-3**: Core infrastructure (auth, base models, DRF foundation)
- **Week 4-5**: Timeclock functionality (entry, OT calculation, approvals)
- **Week 6-7**: Request management (Holiday/Leave/TOIL) and balance tracking
- **Week 8**: Reports (timecard, balances), CSV import/export, notifications, settings
- **Week 9**: Testing, polish, and launch
