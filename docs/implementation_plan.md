# About Time - Implementation Plan

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Slow and Deliberate Development

We commit to a slow and deliberate development approach that prioritizes quality over speed. This means:

- **Test as we build**: Every component will have tests written alongside implementation
- **Daily code review**: All code will undergo review before merging
- **Weekly demos**: Working functionality will be demonstrated weekly
- **No rushing**: We will not compromise quality to meet deadlines
- **Document as we go**: Update documentation with each feature implementation

### 2. Strict Feature Control

We will strictly adhere to the defined MVP scope and actively resist feature creep:

- **PRD as source of truth**: All features must trace back to the PRD
- **Approval required**: Any scope change requires explicit approval
- **Parking lot**: Capture good ideas for future consideration without implementing them now
- **Regular scope review**: Weekly review to ensure we're still on track with original scope
- **"No" as default**: The default answer to new feature requests during MVP is "no"

### 3. Ask Questions Before Implementing

We will maintain a culture of questioning and clarity:

- **Question ambiguities**: Identify and question any ambiguous requirements
- **Document decisions**: Record all clarifications and decisions in the appropriate docs
- **Validate assumptions**: Explicitly validate assumptions before coding
- **Regular check-ins**: Schedule regular check-ins to address questions
- **No guessing**: Never guess about requirements - always seek clarification

### 4. Technical Standards

We will follow these technical standards throughout development:

- **UV as Python package manager**: All Python dependencies will be managed with UV
- **Docker for development**: Use Docker for consistent development environments
- **TypeScript for frontend**: Use TypeScript for all frontend code
- **Django best practices**: Follow Django's recommended patterns and practices
- **Comprehensive testing**: Maintain high test coverage
- **Consistent code style**: Use linters and formatters (Black, ESLint, Prettier)

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks and Mitigations

1. **CSRF/CORS Configuration**
   - **Risk**: Authentication issues between frontend and backend
   - **Mitigation**: Early focus on authentication flow, follow documented patterns

2. **Overtime Calculation Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Incorrect calculations leading to inaccurate data
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite, validation with stakeholders

3. **Data Integrity**
   - **Risk**: Balance calculations becoming out of sync
   - **Mitigation**: Database constraints, transaction management, audit logging

4. **Performance Issues**
   - **Risk**: Slow loading times affecting user experience
   - **Mitigation**: Regular performance testing, optimization of database queries

5. **Feature Creep**
   - **Risk**: Scope expansion delaying completion
   - **Mitigation**: Strict adherence to PRD, formal change control process

## Questions to Ask Before Implementation

For each feature, we will ask these questions before implementation:

1. Is this feature explicitly defined in the PRD?
2. Is this a must-have feature for the MVP?
3. Do we have complete requirements, or are there ambiguities?
4. Are there any technical constraints or dependencies?
5. How will we test this feature?
6. How will we know this feature is successful?
7. Does this feature affect other parts of the system?

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. 100% of timeclock entries can be submitted through the system
2. Approvals can be completed within the 7-day target
3. Overtime calculations are accurate according to configured settings
4. All pages load in under 2 seconds
5. The system supports 3-5 concurrent users without performance degradation
6. All defined MVP features are implemented and tested
7. Documentation is complete and up-to-date
