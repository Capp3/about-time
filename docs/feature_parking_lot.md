# About Time - Feature Parking Lot

This document tracks features and ideas that have been suggested but are intentionally **not included in the MVP scope**. The purpose is to acknowledge good ideas without expanding scope, helping us maintain focus on delivering the core MVP functionality.

## How to Use This Parking Lot

1. When a feature request or idea arises that's not in the current PRD/scope:
   - Add it to this document with appropriate details
   - Note the source/requestor
   - Assign a rough priority for post-MVP consideration

2. During MVP development:
   - Refer to this document when there are questions about scope
   - Do not implement these features until after MVP completion
   - Use this list to politely defer feature requests

3. Post-MVP planning:
   - Use this list as a starting point for next phase planning
   - Re-evaluate priorities based on user feedback and business needs

## Feature Promotion Process

Before a parked feature can be promoted to active development:

1. MVP must be completed and released
2. Feature must be formally specified and added to requirements
3. Impact analysis must be performed
4. Resource and timeline estimates must be provided
5. Feature must be prioritized against other parked features
6. Formal approval must be obtained

This process ensures we maintain a disciplined approach to feature development even after MVP completion.
